*/

As a general rule, any original work that adds value to an Open Source project can be shared on Utopian. [See the contribution guidelines](https://utopian.io/rules).

Utopian does have categories into which one may post and these include the following:

- Suggestions
- Sub-projects
- Development
- Bug Hunting
- Translation
- Graphics
- Analysis
- Visibility
- Documentation
- Tutorials
- Video Tutorials
- Copywriting

This list is not final and more categories may be added as the need arises. If you have a contribution that does not fit into any one of these categories, then feel free to [get in touch with Utopian moderators to suggest a category addition](https://discord.gg/UCvqCsx).
