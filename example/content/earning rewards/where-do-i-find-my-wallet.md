All the STEEM you earn on Utopian is made available to your account when each individual post reaches its payout date, which is 7 days after you published it. At this time, the rewards are available for you to redeem to your account balance.

To see your account balance and to have access to your funds, you will need to go to steemit.com. There is a section named “Wallet” where you can see how much STEEM you own and also have the tools to transfer it, among other things. There is a mobile STEEM wallet app currently being developed by Steemit Inc. and once it is out, it will be the easiest way to manage your STEEM wallet.
